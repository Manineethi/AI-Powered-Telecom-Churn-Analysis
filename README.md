## üìã Project Overview

This project, **AI-Powered Telecom Churn Prediction**, focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn in a telecom dataset of 7,043 customers (27% churn rate). The goal is to identify at-risk customers and provide data-driven retention strategies, maximizing **Churn Recall**  to catch as many churners as possible. The project combines descriptive analysis (churn patterns) and predictive analysis (machine learning models) to deliver actionable insights.

Key Achievements
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Identified churn patterns using Power BI, revealing that month-to-month contract users, fiber optic users, and electronic check payers are most likely to churn.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Built SVM and Random Forest models using Python, achieving a Churn Recall of 76% with SVM (identifying 293 churners out of 385 in the validation set).
- **Business Impact**: Recommended targeting 293 at-risk customers with longer contracts and billing adjustments, potentially saving $293,000 (at $1,000 per customer).
